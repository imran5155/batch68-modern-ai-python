# Assignments for Class 09 (2025-02-01)

1. Write a class that represents a bank account. It should have the following methods:
    - `__init__(self, name, balance)`: Constructor that initializes the name and balance of the account.
    - `deposit(self, amount)`: Method that deposits the given amount into the account.
    - `withdraw(self, amount)`: Method that withdraws the given amount from the account.
    - `get_balance(self)`: Method that returns the current balance of the account.

2. Write a class that represents a circle. It should have the following methods:
    - `__init__(self, radius)`: Constructor that initializes the radius of the circle.
    - `get_area(self)`: Method that returns the area of the circle.
    - `get_circumference(self)`: Method that returns the circumference of the circle.

3. Write a class that represents a rectangle. It should have the following methods:
    - `__init__(self, width, height)`: Constructor that initializes the width and height of the rectangle.
    - `get_area(self)`: Method that returns the area of the rectangle.
    - `get_perimeter(self)`: Method that returns the perimeter of the rectangle.

4. Write a class that represents a student. It should have the following methods:
    - `__init__(self, name, age, grades)`: Constructor that initializes the name, age, and grades of the student.
    - `get_average_grade(self)`: Method that returns the average grade of the student.
    - `get_highest_grade(self)`: Method that returns the highest grade of the student.
    - `get_lowest_grade(self)`: Method that returns the lowest grade of the student.

5. Write magic methods that can be used to compare two objects of the same class. Implement these methods in the classes you have written in the previous questions.

6. Get magic methods (methods with double underscores `__method__`) and their descriptions from the Python documentation and write a brief explanation of each method with example. You can use any previously written class to demonstrate the usage of these magic methods.  
Examples:
    - `__str__(self)`: Method that returns a string representation of the object.
    - `__add__(self, other)`: Method that defines the behavior of the `+` operator.


7. Get magic attributes (attributes with double underscores `__attribute__`) and their descriptions from the Python documentation and write a brief explanation of each attribute with example. You can use any previously written class to demonstrate the usage of these magic attributes.
    - `__doc__`: Attribute that contains the docstring of the class or function.
    - `__name__`: Attribute that contains the name of the class or function.
    - `__dict__`: Attribute that contains the namespace of the class or function.
